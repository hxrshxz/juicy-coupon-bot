> :information_source: You need to set up a suitable cron job similar to
> [ours](https://github.com/juice-shop/juicy-coupon-bot/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Monthly+Coupon+Distribution%22).
> Next you need a BlueSky account
> to which you obviously have to provide your own identifier (i.e. email) and app password for
> the environment variables `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER` and
> `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`. For Mastodon integration you have to generate an [Access Token](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/authorized/) and pass it in via `MASTODON_TOKEN` along with the `MASTODON_URL` of your instance. For Reddit integration you need a [Reddit App](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and have to
> define the environment variables `REDDIT_ACCOUNT_NAME`,
> `REDDIT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`, `REDDIT_APP_ID` and `REDDIT_APP_SECRET`.
